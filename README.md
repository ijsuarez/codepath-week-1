## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was having trouble getting the search function to work. I think I was starting to get a decent idea of what was wrong, but I ran out of time and had to submit my work. In the future I need to get started on the optional features earlier.

~~There also exists a bug where the app crashes when you try to search and there are no movies to search during network errors. Also, in the transition to a collection view, you can no longer pull down to reload when no movies are shown.~~

Fixed bugs and got search to work. Too bad it's after the deadline lol.
